In this workshop I have learned how to use numeric libraries for accumulating data
how to apply lambda expressions to specify an operation on each value in a data set
and also how to use algorithm library to sort data values.
In this workshop i have used vector as my container that stores data from the file. 
I choose to use vectors because they are expandable in size, we don't need to think about the
size of the vector, particulary when we don't know how many ellements we will need to store in the 
vector and its store data sequencialy. Storing data sequentially is important specially when we calculating
statistics information, which was the task in this workshop.I have used lambda expression in the sort function
to specify how the items in the container need to be sorted.
      std::sort(copy.begin(), copy.end(), [](T i, T j) {return i < j; });
I also have used lambda expression to calculate the sum of y values minus mean.
      t = std::accumulate(y.begin(), y.end(), (T)0,
        [=](T x, T y) { return x + (y-mean) * (y-mean); });

I have also used  following templates to calculate values
- sort
- accumulate
- inner_product
By using this templates its make programming easier because there are already define functions that calculate all the 
neccessary sums for calculating statistical information. Using this templates cuts on using for loops in our code.
