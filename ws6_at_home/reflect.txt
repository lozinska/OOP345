In this workshop I have learned how to use STL containers and their advantages.
In this workshop I have used vector because vector class template define classes 
that manage data structures that can change in size. This mean that vector is a dynamically 
allocated container. Also if we have a large amount of data it would corrupting all free memory
if we would use statically allocated arrays.
We don't have to deallocate memory in this code because std::vector does it for us. As soon as an std::vector
go out of scope it cleans up after itself. std::vector manage the memory and this memory is of pointers, not objects.
Range base for simplify coding because we don't need to overload the operator<<in order to display 
our object we can just use range base and go through the functions that return elements of the object. 
for (auto i : product) {
      i->display(os);
      sum += i->price();
    }
It's also simplify our for loop in case we don't know how many elements in the loop.

Quiz 6 reflection:
1 (3) The algorithms category of the STL consists of the following three libraries:
Wrong: Queries,Modifiers,Manipulators
Correct:Algorithm, functional, numeric
4 (1) The ______________ function templates of the STL perform programmer-specified operations on the elements of a sequential container. 
Wrong: operators
Correct: Transform
6 (2) Write a program that reads the first 10 bytes from a binary file named file and displays them on standard output: 
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>


int main() {
std::ifstream file("file",std::ios::in|std::ios::binary)
char input[10];
file.read(input,10);
for(int i;i<10;i++)
std::cout<<input[i]<<std::endl;
}
